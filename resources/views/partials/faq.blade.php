                 Curb Run does not look for delivery slots. Delivery is the ultimate convenience, but it appears to be next to impossible to get a slot with most services. Curbside pickup has the advantage that you are able to consider multiple stores (if you live in a fairly-densely populated area).

                We currently check stores about every 5 minutes. We are trying to strike a balance between not causing excessive load to the store websites and having checks be frequent enough not to miss slots. We are continously keeping an eye on the load and tweak parameters as necessary.

                 Curb Run does not look for delivery slots. Delivery is the ultimate convenience, but it appears to be next to impossible to get a slot with most services. Curbside pickup has the advantage that you are able to consider multiple stores (if you live in a fairly-densely populated area).

                We currently check stores about every 5 minutes. We are trying to strike a balance between not causing excessive load to the store websites and having checks be frequent enough not to miss slots. We are continously keeping an eye on the volume and tweak parameters as necessary.

                Simply reply <code>DONE</code> to the text message you received from us. Note that we will only send matching timeslots once after a subscription has been created, you will explicitly need to reply with <code>CONTINUE</code> if you want us to keep looking.

                No! This is completely free. Curbside pickup is better for public health and this makes it less frustrating. We are happy to cover the limited costs associated with running the service. We do not share your submitted data with anyone; the only organization that gets to see your phone number is our text service provider, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank">Twilio</a>.

                Reply to the sign-up text message you received from us with <code>DONE</code>. This will stop the subscription. Now go and sign up for Curb Run notifications again with the new phone number.
